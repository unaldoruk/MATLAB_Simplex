This project was assigned to me and my 2 teammates for the course Algortihms & Numerical Methods which I have taken when I was a Junior at the Universoty of Toronto. Each person in the team were assigned to program 1 algorithm.

# The work I have done are the files 'run_SM.m', 'PlotTimes.m', all of the plots, and the Simplex Method portion of the report. 

The rest of the files are provided in order for the 'PlotTimes.m' file to work properly in MATLAB.

Note: There is a missing function file that is used in 'PlotTimes.m' called 'dataGenerator.m'
