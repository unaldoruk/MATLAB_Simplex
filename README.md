This project was assigned to me and my 2 teammates for the course Algortihms & Numerical Methods which I have taken when I was a Junior at the Universoty of Toronto. Each person in the team were assigned to program 1 algorithm.

# The work I have done are the files 'run_SM.m', 'plotTimes.m', all of the plots, and the Simplex Method portion of the report
